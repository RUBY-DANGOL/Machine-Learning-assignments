##  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RUBY-DANGOL/Machine-Learning-assignments.git
cd Machine-Learning-assignments
```
2. **Install dependencies (optional but recommended):
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open any of the .ipynb files to explore and run the code interactively.

##  Key Concepts Covered
- Simple Linear Regression using the Normal Equation

- Multiple Linear Regression with NumPy

- Gaussian Naive Bayes for continuous features

- Multinomial Naive Bayes for discrete/categorical data

- Data visualization and analysis

 ## Notes
- Datasets are included in .csv format inside the repository.

- All algorithms are implemented from scratch for learning purposes unless noted otherwise.
